##  Communication Tools
We use emails and Facebooks to communicate with each other, so that we can easily exchange our ideas.
##  Team Contract
1. I will get my alloted work on time.
2. For each group meeting, I will attend it on time and take participation actively.
3. If there is something urgent preventing me to take participation in the group meeting, I will notify others immediately.
4. We have to make sure the work is divided roughly equally among all of the team members.
5. I will help others to understand the concept in the project.
6. If I don't understand a concept or a piece of a code, I will immediately ask my team for help.
7. Everyone has to learn all relevant code of a particular part of the project before the next meeting holds.
8. Everyone should take the responsibility and make more effort if he/she cannot attend the meeting for some proper reasons.
##  Do Work in Pairs
We should do work in pairs. We have to hold a group meeting at least every three days to make progress in the project. 
##  Group Meeting
Every group meeting, there should be one person taking and sharing notes.These notes should include all decisions made during the whole meeting. We have to have an idea about how to divide the work when each group meeting holds. We must use a markdown file to record and push it to the repository.
##  Rule
Everybody writes the code. Everyone should make contribution to the whole team.
